rupertavery,"I'm Filipino. I grew up reading English literature. This was 30 years ago, so every character was, in my mind , white. Of couse, as a child, you don't have any preconcieved notions of racism. 

For context, I grew up in Africa with African, British, Indian and Filipino classmates.

I have no real beef with characters ethnicity being changed or whatnot, but of course the source material is... source material. And the adaptation is... an adaptation.

Sometimes changes make sense, sometimes they feel forced.

Raymond E. Fiest's Magican Saga and moreso Serpentwar Saga has different races, although predominantly white main characters because, the writer is Caucasian, I guess, and his setting is a medieval-like world with characters of European descent.

And that's fine with me. I love those books, and the characters within, because of the stories of each character.

TheObservationalist,"I mean...there is no reason it cant be done. But differences exist in skin color because of differences in physical geography. If you just toss people of different skin color together like it's a completely random variant with no explanation, it's going to be weird. GoT handled the existence of different races well. There were established geographical homelands, with individuals traveling around in between. Even the final season of Castlevaynia (which you can tell was under pressure to improve their diversity score), gave an actual explanation as to why there was a village of black people living in a mediveal euro setting; their ancestors survived shipwrecks of boats coming from Carthage. It's fine to have mixed, diverse populations, but you need to provide some level of plausible world building to account for where these diverse people came from in fantasy. 

In sci fi this isn't an issue because the reader already presumes the human race is hyper-mobile and any traditional place-based nations long since left behind and all mixed together. It doesn't in any way break the suspension of disbelief. 

I'll provide a counter-example. In the fantastic series Rage of Dragons (which is an afro-fantasy setting), there are absolutely no white people. Is that a problem? The world is fictional after all? Why couldn't there be asians or white people??! ....because it is a *distinctively*  African-flavored fantasy setting. The presence of white people would be jarring and weird and pull you out of the place and time.  Did the fact that there were no white people decrease my enjoyment of RoD? It did not. Because the *characters* were are human, and written well. You can identify with their pain and struggle and love and loss, and enjoy the creative world building and themes.

In the same way, if the fantasy universe in question is very obviously medieval fantasy england/ireland/viking and some people are randomly black i just find it confusing.

the1lonelysailor,"I suppose the only “issue” I would have is that: it depends. 

Most modern fantasy in western culture builds off Lord of the Rings. LoTR was specifically written to be a British Mythology. The way Tolkien saw it, all other cultures had fantastic mythologies surrounding them. From East Asians to Africans to Indians to Nords, these cultures were rich with tales of heroes and monsters and so on. 

But England did not. 

Tolkien wanted the English to have a fully fleshed-out set of stories to compete with all the others. Middle Earth is Great Britain in an earlier time. 

Do modern fantasy writers have to be beholden to Tolkein’s idea? Does he own the idea of dwarves and elves and magic?
No
But it’s also true that *his* interpretation of those concepts are what most writers include. 

Even still, that doesn’t mean a modern fantasy writer must make all characters proper Englishmen, but the reason these characters are usually white is because they were written by a white guy, for the English.

sirbruce,"As a white author myself I have no trouble with writing characters of a different skin color in my work.  However, being told I need to do so in every story for the sake of diversity is extremely difficult, because it leads to accusations of:

1. Pandering and tokenism. ""The character is supposedly black but they act white.""  Yeah, because they're in an entirely different (fictional) culture, not the one you know.

2. Cultural appropriation.  ""White people shouldn't write non-white characters because they can't really understand them."" or ""The author is using ethnic cultural terms or values they don't have a right to use.""  This creates a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

3. Racism.  ""Your character of ethnic background X was *too* X, composed mostly of stereotypes and slurs, therefore you are a racist.""  If I don't write a Asian character that confirms exactly to what the reader wants to see -- and different readers want different things -- then I'm the bad guy.  Even if I admit, up front, that I'm a white author who doesn't really know all the ins and outs of Asian culture but felt like I had to write an Asian character anyway.

I understand the *desire* to see people who ""look and think like me"" in books or on video or film.  But by the same (ahem) token, not every white cis male that is featured is ""me"" either.  Darth Vader doesn't represent me.

hrs922,">But when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity

*He says as his panties are massively twisted*",29
kchoze,"Please learn about the concept of ""verisimilitude"".

Basically, the concept is that even in a fictional world where there is magic and dragons, it is important that the world ""feels"" real, like a real world which may function differently than ours, but is still internally coherent. And in fact, the more similar it is to the real world, the more people will feel drawn in to it. When you decide to add, as you put it, ""forced diversity"" into it so that it reflects the diversity of early 21st century America, people do notice that it's not internally coherent (not unless there is a good in-story reason for it) and suspension of disbelief will be harder to achieve.

For example, the reason A Song of Ice and Fire has so much pull is that it FEELS like a real, internally consistent world. There is diversity, but only where it makes sense, in King's Landing and the Free Cities which are subject to plenty of trade and movement, otherwise, ""black"" people come from a different continent where the climate is similar to that of subsaharan Africa, and the like. In other words, local peoples have features that reflect the climate of the places in which they live, [just like they do in real life](https://sruk.org.uk/skin-color-an-example-of-adaptation-to-the-environment/). Likewise, the mores around sexuality and marriage in Westeros fit to the context of life in Westeros, which reflects medieval Europe and so sexuality and marriage reflect medieval cultural mores. If ASOIAF (and the resulting TV series) had reflected MODERN sexual mores, it would have been far less interesting and coherent and would have been viewed as cheap fare, not a fantasy masterpiece.

The decision of authors to satisfy the demands of contemporary moral puritans and reflect our society rather than actually create an internally consistent world for their story should bother people, because it results in what I would controversially argue is objectively worse stories because readers aren't stupid and notice the very self-conscious nature of the writing.

I'm not saying diversity makes something bad, I'm saying any story element that is present for reasons outside of the internal consistency of the story and the world it exists in makes suspension of disbelief harder and makes the story worse. If there are reasons for diversity, like you write a story for Sigil, the city of doors which is connected to every place in the multiverse, and everyone is ""caucasian"", then that is as big a problem as if you write a small isolated village in a low-fantasy world as if it had the racial makeup of Manhattan.",98
KaiserInch,"One thing I hate about these conversations is anyone who doesn’t immediately agree gets stamped with the “close-minded” card. 

I don’t think it’s unreasonable if someone thinks it’s weird for a random character of race to just be in a story. “Are they from a different town or nation? Is the culture supposed to the same?” Most of the time you should just hand-wave it away because ultimately it’s unimportant. But if you have a random Asian hobbit and all the other hobbits are white? It’s not small-minded to think it’s weird.

I think it’s weird seeing race in some sci-fi that’s way off in the future. “You have another 600 years of human culture with everyone sleeping with everyone, and yet we still have people who look 100% white/Asian/black/etc.",58

CarsomyrPlusSix,"It depends.  Are you basing your setting on medieval Europe or a similar era where world travel is difficult and uncommon and you wouldn't see a lot of folks from different parts of the world, which is why populations of humans look different in the first place, i.e. adapting to vastly different, geographically distant environments over long periods of time?

If so, such characters should be exotic and rare and not just background; you'd expect locals to be surprised to see them, some marvelling, some prejudiced.  You wouldn't just throw them around randomly, but merchants in major trade hub cities would be reasonable.

It's a matter of being coherent in your world design.

Dragons should also make sense within the context of your world.  You should have a understandable magic system, how it works, who gets to cast it, is it learned or self-taught, are there different schools, are they tied to culture or location, etc.  

Magic can alleviate some of this through rapid travel or even teleportation, but then you have to think about that; if folks can just teleport, why do humans even look different, is the teleportation strictly limited, a recent development, what?",122

On the other hand, old societies that are less developed tend to have less diversity, and this makes sense as globalisation is directly influenced by advances in global infrastructure and travel.  If a fictional town is clearly based off of medieval Europe, it’s perfectly okay for everyone to be white, and (in my opinion) it can be kinda off putting if some characters have different ethnicities without any explanation, it brings me out of the fictional world somewhat.

Cross_Yuki,"I think authors should be free to create their fantasy worlds and there shouldn't be any obligation for including diversity. This obligation would kill originality and make all stories similar, cut by the same pattern, repeating the same formula. What is important here is that all types of authors are given an opportunity and there is diversity in the writers. Then, naturally we will have more variety of universes and kinds of people represented in books. If there is any social group that feels underrepresented in literature, I think the way to help is to give voice to new authors that will represent them, not to criticise other people for not including absolutely everyone in their books.",20
Left4DayZ1,"Look I'll just be blunt about it - if someone wrote a fantasy epic based in Africa (which, by the way, sounds like a cool fucking idea), would you require them to arbitrarily insert white people for the sake of inclusion? I'd guess not, because it would be silly - weren't too many white people wandering around that continent back in the middle ages where most fantasy seems to take place, it would be just a little bit absurd for a ""white knight"" to show up.

So let's flip it back around again. Since most fantasy takes place in the middle ages in Europe, and the demographic makeup of that region in those times was overwhelmingly ""white"", is it racist to adhere to that racial demographic makeup? Or historical?

""But Fantasy isn't historical"" - you're right. It isn't. It's a fictional twist on a historic time period, though - effectively no different than placing super hero stories in the modern day, if you think about it. They're still largely based in the framework of reality, with fantastical elements that break out FROM our reality.

You really want to get into this, we should be asking why the majority of naturalized humans on Tatooine were pasty-faced white folks. The plant has two suns for fuck's sake. White skin on Tatooine natives is as unrealistic as anything.

In a situation like that even if the town started off ethnically diverse at its founding, which it probably wouldn't, then after so many generations the town would have in all likelihood homogenized into a uniform racial group across the whole town. It might make sense to have a few characters that aren't of the same racial background, but they would probably be recent immigrants. If you just started making that town extremely mixed race then it would take away from the immersion of the story because you would probably only see that demographic make up in a larger trading hub city.

2. The narration focuses unnecessarily on the race of characters whose race is not relevant simply to highlight how diverse the cast is. The J. K.

intenseskill,"But most fantasy is based in times where we do not have as much technology meaning there will be less people travelling from different lands. If a story is based in a place where one race lives then their needs to be a reason why other races are there. If i was watching a movie that was based in a place with mostly asians or black people and there was one white guy just there i would wanna know and would think it should tell us why he is there as it would seem really weird.

Tbh i have not seen people getting pissed about this sort of stuff. I have seen people getting pissed about their being no diversity in certain things like the witcher for example.

Honestly i think it is pretty dumb both ways. If you get pissed that there is not enough diversity in a certain thing then you are dumb (unless it is written by a known racist and you know it is purposeful) just the same if you get pissed that someone decided to write people from different races or with different coloured skin then you are also very dumb.

d1rtyd0nut,"**I originally misinterpreted what you're saying here, so the beginning of my comment is a bit weird. Still, there are some good points, so I'm gonna leave it as is.**



Oh hell no. I hate this type of thinking.

Of course diversity is important, but not important enough to force it onto people's art. If I create something, that something has come out of me. I basically let my creativity out onto the canvas. I know it sounds pretentious, but ask any person in the art world, and they'll tell you that they have a vision on the inside that they try their best to realize.

Just because there is no reason that a piece of media shouldn't feature an asian person, and really if you have magic and shit there is no good reason, doesn't mean you have to put one in there. If your vision simply doesn't include any asian people, that doesn't mean you're racist, it doesn't mean you're close-minded, and it doesn't mean you're doing something wrong. It's your art, and if you try to make it fit to other people's expectations on what is and isn't acceptable, it will invariably get worse.

This also applies in the reverse, like you outlined pretty well. Just because some person thinks I can't have an asian wizard in my fantasy story, because it's ""not realistic"" or whatever, doesn't mean I should make him white. It's my vision, and my choice. Go nuts. Do your thing. Just stay true to your vision.",3
fromcjoe123,"The only question is, is it immersive. A lot of cheap direct to streaming fantasy reboots have what I would consider ""forced diversity"" when you have a perfectly ethnically diverse cast playing people all from allegedly the same place in a world clearly based upon Medieval Europe, because it does feel cheap and forced. 

If you want a fantasy world tied together with feudal tropes and set at a technology level of say the 1200-1300s, you're not under any circumstances going to get that much diversity from the same place from the same nation state unless you're dealing with a huge empire like in the Elder Scrolls series or like historical Rome where there is a reason for that many different people to be all over the place outside of being the extremely small % of the population that could plausibly be traders.

If they want to a fantasy story based on Ming China, and they have a white dude in there, it feels equally weird for him to just be a white dude without any explanation.

In Martins Game of Thrones world I believe its done pretty well, and not overt. The first men and andals are similar to southern and northern Europeans, respectively. ""Chivalry"" was even imported to Westeros by the Andals. 
Then the Dornish people were similar to our Middle Easterners. The people far to the East of Essos - ""Ashaii"" if I remember right, were vaguely Asian sounding...and not part of this story just mentioned, seen as very mysterious to the people of the West. 
There were ""black skinned"" men from some islands that made their way to various places in the West.
Even the Children of the Forest in Westeros were meant to represent native americans in our world, to some degree.

On Ashaii- its interesting that they are acknowledged but play no role in the goings on of this story...similarly in our world we have mountains of Western-centric history, thousands of years of ""world events"" from the ME to Europe to the New World... and that whole time China was trucking along in their own world with empires and innivation and exploration.",5

Does this fantasy world just so happen to also have an ""Asian"" continent, and do those people just so happen to look like what we think of when we think of ""Asian""?  

There are plenty of books with plenty of diversity out there. There are also books (and all other media) where diversity is forced, and/or makes no sense within the context of the story. I don't think the idea that diversity is fine in fiction is a particularly hot take - I don't think most people will disagree with that opinion. I think more people will take exception to your idea that character choices of this nature are only questioned for reasons of politics or indoctrination, and that that there are no sound, legitimate reasons to otherwise question these types of story building decisions. Like, an island nation that has never had contact with the outside world should be almost completely homogeneous.

MrOrangeXD,"So I don't consume a LOT of fantasy media, but i think an issue is whether the world/lore is ""lol magic land, fantasy and wonder!"" Or a believable world with lore, history and realistic social strife.

Why do white/black people exist in the first place? White people come from cold places, and black people come from hot places.

The Witcher? Game of Thrones? Elder Scrolls? These universes have ""reasons"" for why people are certain races. And stories can be built from them.

If you have two characters, one black and one white, from the same village, and they seemingly have no historical or geometric legacy, then it's like... what is the point being made here?

If humans were created by some sort of god entity and humans were just assigned random skin colours, then that's fine - though I argue that the only value of that diversity is surface level becuase it has no relevance to why diversity is important in the real world.

I thought we were being proud of black heritage and history, and making people aware of the horrors and hardships they had to overcome to have a place in many western counties? If racial history doesn't exist at all, then isn't the diversity kind of hollow and ignorant?

There's a reason why the characters of Attack on Titan are Germanic white people for example. There's a reason why Redgards come from Hammerfell in Elder Scrolls.

Why do I care? I mean, i donnnnt. But my favourite worlds are ones where even the bloody flowers have a well thought out reason for being there. And not only that, I care about minorities being represented well, not have their struggles be hand waved in some idealised fantasy world where racism never existed.

Two bits from your edit strike me the wrong way. So much so that it seems clear to me that you're just completely ignoring anyone who isn't in complete agreement with you. 

>Diversity doesn't ever need justification. Ever. I shouldn't have to justify my existence. Especially when you never try to justify the existence of white people. 

It does though. If the setting in question is one that doesn't have any reason or justification for ethnicities to be intermingling or for easy travel over long distances, there's no reason to have to have people that are distinctly different races. I don't see how you could then try to say that means you would have to justify *your* existence since that it's pretty obvious. If you're black you have some ancestry that traces back to a region that black people originated from, the same for Asian from Asia, etc. 

You've made a statement of [d]iversity doesn't ever need justification"" as a matter of fact but that isn't how discussions work. You're talking about a hypothetical work as if it's someone talking about you after this, so that isn't your unnecessary but added anyway justification. 


>no, ""just imagining the characters as whatever you want"" isn't an answer. If the character is clearly described as a white dude, and is casted as a white dude in the movies, me imagining he looks like me does nothing to fix the issues we're talking about. 

What do you do in scenarios where a character is coded as white in the source material but a different race in the movie? Does this retroactively change the source text in your mind or does the change in the movie not matter? You've taken a position that makes changing a characters race seem to be a rare thing.

In Game of Thrones Daario Nahaaris (not sure if I remember his name correctly, the brigand boyfriend Dany has at one point) looked nothing like himself, his hair was supposed to have blue hair and a yellow stache or something. I hate it when a series or movie does that. Obviously all etnicities can be in a fantasy series, but it feels incredibly forced (when there's literally no reason to do so) when they put in a character of a different etnicity for a role that's just not that.

Congrats, you got a bunch of upvotes and reddit rewards for posting a milquetoast opinion that everyone else already agrees with.

I'm willing to bet the bulk of all fantasy written in Africa has predominantly black characters and the bulk of all fantasy written in Asia has predominantly Asian characters.

Diversity in certain scenarios just can't make sense. Writers can make the choice for that aspect of their story to not make sense for the sake of having diversity and generally it's not too distracting, but it's still noticeable.

Compare Game of Thrones vs The Witcher. The diversity in the Witcher made absolutely zero sense; you had a medieval setting with Jet Black people living in the same village as Asian families and lily white people. Game of thrones diversity had diverse characters that all came from different parts of the world in a way where having a multitude of ethnicities together in the show made sense.

The point of contention is never the diversity itself, it's whether it's explained or done in a logical way because no matter what your brain still notices when something just doesn't make sense.

Are you writing your own story, go nuts. Write the story you want. If that's all white, all black, or as rainbow a recruiting billboard, you do you. 

Is it an adaptation of an existing work/myth/etc. Then no, I generally think you should hold truer to whatever it is. Making a LoTR tv show, the elves should be white. Making a Journey to the West movie, Tang Sanzang is Chinese. Han Chinese. Merlin the TV show, Gwenevere being black was a mistake.

Now back to original worlds. I stand by what I said, you write the story you want, but I'll add some thoughts of what I like in my fantasy stories. 

For me, one of the biggest appeals of fantasy and sci-fi are the settings. And just like with a character, a setting can't be everything. It's defined as much by what isn't there as what is there. I know a number of hopeful writers and enjoy listening to their stories about their worlds. One that I particularly enjoy draws most of its inspiration from the pre-columbian american southwest and meso-america. It's not diverse in the way we tend to think of it, at all. There's really only two ethnic groups and though they think they are distinct from each other, if you were casting them for live media you'd have to draw both from the same pretty small pool of irl people. If you added an asian, black, or white actor in a background scene, it would be a problem.

I'll take it a step further. I don't care if main characters are diverse. If it's a fictional world not based on any real people I say go nuts. People say it's pandering but litterally it's all pandering. White dudes get pandered too so much they don't even notice it like a fish in water. Let me have a bad ass Asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards. I don't care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that's not based on actual things that happened doesn't and shouldn't bother anyone.

aSimpleTraveler,"I think this is a consequence of who is writing the story and what it is based on. Much of modern fantasy games/stories are based on the folklore of northern Europe as well as much of the content from LOTR. The majority of the people who began and participated in creating this content were of Northern European descent. Quite honestly, I think they did not think to add this content at first and it has come to feel like the ""correct"" ethnic group to use in the content.

I think this is changing though with video game content made by Japanese owned companies and various shades of skin being added to new games. Book-wise, I  am sure there are newer fantasy and sci-fi stories that may be inspired by the mythology from above, but that have been made anew by people from different ethnic backgrounds.

I think the hard part is, that much of fantasy, again, is either inspired by Northern European mythology and history or colonial history, etc... and takes the view and focus of Northern Europeans.

In the same vein, I am sure that there is ""fantasy"" written by Mexican authors, but I am unsure if it would focus on Knights and Wizards, as this was not really part of Mexican or even Spanish culture. Instead it would be more of a quest for gold and ancient secrets, or exploring ancient Aztec ruins, or something of the sort. It would be connected to the mythos and the history of the people writing it.

I think as more inter-cultural and inter-ethnic marriages occur and we have youth of an African-American and Welsh-American who grows up to be a writer, then the content of the characters will change. Just as I am sure a child who grew up with parents who were Ghanaian and Dutch would have a very interesting and new view of high fantasy, etc....

In short, I think you are right that there is no good reason to NOT include various shades of skin in a fantasy story. I think some people either don't think to due to their own backgrounds and interest. I am sure it is also true that some people do not think it ""feels"" right. I think I can partially understand that, if I were to watch a Bollywood movie or read a Chinese novel with all the main characters being Germans, then it would be quite strange and not feel right. When it comes to nations like the US and Canada with a lot more ethnic diversity, I think that is where it gets even more complicated. At the end of the day, I think you can just point to whoever is writing the book and what they have been exposed to.

I think as more dwarves have darker skin, or elves have new features that it will, over time, become a norm. What I don't understand is the people who resist these changes. What I do understand though, is what it is happening now. 

Edit after re-read of post: I also think that at times inserting a character in stories that are specifically said to be ""Asian (which country?)"" or ""African (which country?)"" is somewhat pandering and just meant to boost sales of the book. I think it is something really modern. I like more what Elder Scrolls has done in making completely new ethnic groups in their games that have various skin colors. The light skinned people in LOTR for example are not English or Danish, etc... they are completely different beings. So if a person with darker skin is going to be in a book, I want there to be a better back story than, ""see we have an Asian!"" With that said, I definitely still agree that I think it is silly when people get their ""panties in a bunch"" about it. Though, I think that conversation about pandering or just adding characters specified by real-life concocted racial groups in order to escape labels of ""racism"" or ""white supremacy"" is a valid one to have.",2

cheesyramennoddle,"I am asian but read mostly English fantasy/sci-fi. I am not bothered by lack of representation of ""other races"" whatsoever. I am in for a good adventure, an interesting story and beautiful styles, not there to insert myself into the main characters. Do I feel left out? No. If I do feel left out somehow I would attempt to write my own fantasy or read those in my native language. 

Also if you have a fantasy world where exactly would this Asia or Africa be? It wouldn't make sense to have a group of Asian people in Middle Earth or in Witcher's world because geographically Asia/Africa does not exist or is not named so in those worlds. I wouldn't mind if you have a Asian playing Easterling or black person playing idk dark elf or some kind of dwarf or Maiar in Tolkien's world but it would be ridiculous to have an Asian person (with dark hair and yellow skin) to play Vanyar or have a blonde Caucasian playing Noldor or black person playing Sindarin. Technically there is nothing stopping you physically....but you'd be mocked by fans who respect the originals, and I say this as a racial minority that I would write angry letter if you dare to cast a black hair yellow skin Asian as Vanyar or Sindarin elf. This is not diversity, it is stupidity. 

Similar to this Ariel cast. Com' on if you are literate you'd understand the description of the mermaid's complexion is a very specific one in terms of skin texture, color and eye color. If you want to cast black or white people you can cast them as the sisters the sea King or the witch. Anderson did not know genetic and it is fantasy so the sisters or even dad could totally be black, but why exactly do they have to choose a dark skin brown eye actor as Ariel who clearly has white skin and blue eye??? why??? Or how about don't call her Ariel because that is not how Ariel looks like according to her creator!

It deeply bothers me when people don't read the books/originals when choosing their cast. I'd be equally outraged if they choose a pale irish or a fair blonde as Ged in Earthsea. I'd only be happy with a very tanned and dark caucasian/gaul, black african or brown indian. Not even my fellow asian would do, as much as I love my culture.",6

Characters with different skin colors exist in fantasy stories. And the descriptions used are chosen to reflect that world and its societies within it. There are no Asians in Tolkiens writings because Asia does not exist in Middle-Earth, nor does Africa. However, there are references to people of dark skin and even oriental appearances; they just aren't featured or prominent because Tolkien focused his stories on one part of one specific continent.

Then there are like 3 black people who are just there... No region. No native area. There is an Amazon jungle but the natives are white. There is a desert kingdom but the natives range from white to middle eastern in skin tone. All they had to do was have somewhere, but it's not there.

They could have had an area with any kind of setting they wanted and had the native people be black and it would all fit but because there isn't any place in the world, there is a bit of dissonance between the characters in the lore.

I think where those people who look for diversity are coming from is that these fictional worlds that authors create are a reflection of our own society.

There’s dark overloads, hero’s, and world conquerors in fantasy worlds just like in our own world. 

So when we read these stories, yeah they’re great to enjoy and for entertainment, but there is always an aspect where we are reading about our own reality within these stories. I mean the author is literally a human on this planet so I don’t see where else they’re going to get their ideas. 

And just like when we read a story, as we make these connections to our own society, we look for these connections within ourselves as well. We want to see ourselves in the hero’s shoes, or we might know someone who’s been through trauma like the villain, or perhaps our quests aren’t too different. 
Similarly enough, people wouldn’t mind seeing a little diversity in these stories either, just as much as we want to see ourselves, or our own society through the story.

You can have different nations with a big diversity of not only skin color but also of culture and religion. You could also have diversity in your main contry with the right reason like: their ancestors were refugees of a political/religious cleansing that occurred in their own country, and that was so long ago that everyone is just part of our nation at this point. Or it could be a big Port City where the common trade of various regions has caused people of all places to settle down in that City and zones nearby. Etc.",-1
Josquius,"Zero issue with diversity in fantasy. But I do like it to be explained.

Its a major pet peeve of mine when watching Sci fi series on TV, they come to some small community of a few hundred people isolated from everyone else for many centuries.... And there's a random dark skinned black extra scattered amongst the crowd.

I mean sure. Genetics is weird. It's possible to remain hidden for generations then suddenly pop up. But no. It's an immersion breaker.

If you're going to have diverse characters then make it clear they're from very far away or that there are a bunch of other people of their race around. A bit of background on how you have this totally different group of people there is also welcome.

Tbh I think this is more a TV problem than a books problem. Case in point black Harmoine. Loads of characters are described in a way where they could be from a variety of races.

But in the show many of the characters were cast as people of colour, even though they were white in the books, and of course, people said ""I don't have any problem with black people, I just care about historical accuracy, there wouldn't have been any african american people in Europe at that time"", etc.

Well, yeah, ok, but there also wouldn't have been wizards, magic spells, monsters, or ELVES either, but noone complained about them. Suddenly once a black person shows up everyone is a history expert.

Academic_Paramedic72,"You see, as much as I agree, I think the main problem is that there is a huge monopoly of *european* culture in fantasy settings; even things we think as universal such as dwarves, elves, dragons, vampires and ogres are all mostly adapted from european folklore, or at least the versions as we know them. Yes, they aren't real, but they are still loosely based on the culture of real people. So instead of just using european settings again and again, with the difference that this time it has a more diverse cast, I think we should make more diverse fantasy settings inspired by the cultural background of different people across the world (regardless of the background of the characteds). How many successful fantasy books inspired by african cultures do we know compared to european ones? 
Again, there is absolutely no problem in using a diverse cast in fantasy settings with european background, especially considering their proeminence in media; it's supposed to be an *original story in a completely different world* , not a faithful adaptation of folktales and european folklore, and even then adaptations have artistic liberties.

The relationships between the diversity of creatures living together on an interstellar transport was the core of the first book.  There were alien creatures of every possible description and a few sentient AI personas.

MrFunnyMoustache,"The way I see it, darker skin is just more melanin, and groups of people who spent many generations in environments with more intense UV radiation exposure are likely to have more melanin in their skin. At the same time, groups of people who spent many generations with low UV radiation exposure are likely to have evolved to have less melanin in their skin, so their body can more efficiently produce vitamin D.

When world-building, I need to ask myself questions from evolutionary biology, rather than just going with what sounds fun. If the entire world is getting very low amount of UV because of different environmental factors, or that travel between continents is limited, and so it would be rare to find people with certain skin colours.",1

FatalTragedy,"In this case I agree, but in other cases not having to do with race, I see this same logic a lot of the time and I don't think it applies all the time. Like for example, Game of Thrones some people were wondering why a specific character who was notably fat at the start has not lost any weight, given that he has been very active during the events of the series doing things that would notably burn lots of calories, and also sometimes finding himself in situations where food is scarce. 

The actor who played him thought that was a dumb question, because of logic reminiscent of this post; he basically said ""this world has dragons and magic, but for some reason my character not losing weight is what you can't believe?"" I don't fully agree with his logic here though. Magic and dragons, while not in our world, are fully consistent with the rules of the world established in the show/books. But magically not losing weight is *not* an ability established in the universe, and is therefore not consistent with the mechanics of the world as put worth, unlike dragons. So to me it would be entirely reasonable to not question dragons while still wondering why that character isn't losing weight.

In this case of race, obviously having different nations with different races of people is perfectly consistent with the rules of the universe for any fantasy book, so there is no reason to take issue with that. I do think though that if you're writing fantasy based in a time period where individual societies weren't typically that diverse within themselves, like say the middle ages, that if you want to move from just having different races in different parts of the world and instead make, say, a notably diverse city with many different races all in the same city, there should be an in universe explanation for why that city is so diverse, since such a city goes against the normal expectation for such a society, even if there are also magic and dragons involved.",1

SammyMhmm,"I think that the best stories, fantasy or not, are grounded in reality when they can, and even if they aren't they abide by a certain set of rules. You naturally have to lend the story some leeway when there are obvious fantasy elements to it, like dragons or magic, but race tends to have a lot to do with geographic location and so it will stand out far more in a story set in a medieval tundra if there is just one black character unless their background is explained further. I'm not a big fantasy reader but I think Martin did a great job of this in ASOIF, where characters of color (to the real world perceived as asian, black, white and middle eastern) all have some geographic setting that they hail from and their background is consistent with how we understand race. For instance, it's harder to accept a black character in a tundra, where there isn't a lot of sunlight, because black skin-color comes from excess exposure to sunlight over centuries. So without the background to where that character's race comes from, it seems a little odd because it conflicts with out preconceived understanding of race, and tends to feel like the author is purposely putting characters of color into a story to appeal to the current masses rather than contribute to the story. 

I think that neither you nor I are wrong, it just depends on how the story or characters are written, and how it's perceived to the individual reader, rather than absolutes like Dragons+Magic=Can't complain about diversity.",1

craig1f,"I mean, depends on the setting. 

One of my favorite series, which I just recently finished, was the Broken Earth Trilogy (which just announced a deal with Sony for either a movie or a show). The author is black and female, and as a result, the main characters are all black and female, without needing to explain why they're black and female. It's just the default option, and it is as natural as a white male would be 99% of the rest of the time. 

But, she has painted this bleak future of our planet where the Earth has basically revolted against the human infection. Everyone is black, and they've never seen a white person before. She goes into detail about all the different flavors of black that survived the breaking of the world. The main character can figure out other character's backgrounds by hair color, darkness of skin, eye color, and and body modifications. 

If you just dropped a white person, or an Asian person, into this setting, I would have to know why. Was there some lost tribe that survived the breaking, that was based from North America or Europe? How is this relevant to the plot? Why are we just learning about them now???

Another example is, in the Expanse, most of the people that populated Mars in the first wave were either from Texas and India. So, Martian culture tends to have a strong and bizarre mix of Indian people with Southern drawls and cowboy hats. 

You have to understand that, while plenty of people are just racist and only want white males in their books, plenty of people (like me) are just WAY too fixated on mundane details, and will obsess over the relevance of those details to the plot. Is it a hint about the direction of the story? Or did the author just throw some minorities in there to virtue signal?

Oswalt,"Certain books series it doesn’t make sense for all races to be coexisting peacefully and happily solely due to the fact that tribalism is strong the further you go back.

That being said having a bit of diversity makes more sense than none in so many situations.

For example in the Witcher there was a big debate as to the hiring of a black actress to play Fringilla, as well as a considerably darker complexion actress playing Triss. While it departed from the depiction in the books, frankly it doesn’t really break the suspension of disbelief because they’re fucking mages. They can teleport to and fro, and they specifically search far and wide for magical talent which is rare. While the source material is based on polish folklore and Poland is pretty fucking white especially on its folk lore, this adaptation having a varied cast made sense especially in the smaller knit groups that travel further like the mages guild.

That being said you see the nilfgaardian empire which on the whole doesn’t have a lot of racial diversity but that’s solely because they are solely assimilating from the inside out towards all other nations and the nation itself is not ethnically diverse.

Stepping into another fantasy world for a moment is the Elder Scrolls. A fairly ethnically diverse world that more or less does it right. In Skyrim for example, we are in a snow covered land that is homeland to the Nords a fair eyed and fair skinned with light hair. The area is bordered to the south by Cyrodil, a more Mediterranean and varied temperate zones, homeland to the the Imperials which are close to real world Romans/Italians which have darker hair and tanned skin.

In these two nations they’re is plenty of mixture of diversity due to their proximity and recent status as being part of one nation. It’s common to see Imperials spread all around Skyrim.

Redguards on the other hand come from Hammerfell, a region covered in deserts, grasslands, and mountains and have a natively dark skinned population. Similar to the Middle East Redguards have significantly darker skin and are more noticeable. Due to Hammerfells distance from Skyrim you don’t find as many Redguards barring major trading hubs such as Whiterun or Riften.

This is because traveling without major roads, automobiles, and with the chance of being attacked by trolls, wizards, and daedric demons is dangerous, so less people are going to travel as far.

Not only that but more transient nomadic peoples such as Khajit which hail from Elsweyr even though they have greater numbers traveling, aren’t trusted in Skyrim and are relegated primarily to camps outside the major cities. Few Khajit live in major cities with some such as J’zargo lucking out due to his admission to the Mages guild.

In summation, diversity is 100% okay and is in fact expected in fantasy culture. The only thing that can take people out of it when there is no simple explanation why that person is there and out of place.",1

This is partly why the creatives behind the fantasy movies often times use so much time to build a believable anatomy for their creatures, like dragons etc. There's a very unavoidable reason for why humans developed different skin colors in the different areas of the planet. That's why when a fantasy story is heavily influenced by medieval europe, you need to give an explanation in some way, which is very easy to do, after which you're home free (in my opinion). What's wrong with that? And that can go all ways, if it's a black person in a european society, if it's a white person on an asian inspired society etc. My best current example would be Baranor in the Shadow of Mordor game, he's a black gondorian officer who mentions in an off-hand comment that his family is originally from Harad in the south. It doesn't feel forced and it explains his presence in the western part of middle-earth.",1
shejesa,"Diversity is cool, but it has some issues. Actually, it has one issue called context. The second thing I thought about (cuz the first was a minority Ciri in the witcher) was vinland saga. No matter how you spin it, characters are from what amounts to Scandinavia. North doesn't really facilitate evolving with more pigment in your skin, quite the opposite. Black slaves? Cool, maybe they shipped some. But no natives can be black, or basically anything other than white because it wouldn't make sense, especially in a half-barbarian society.
Moving back to witcher, ciri can't be anything but white as she was a grandchild of a white queen. So unless you get the whole kingdom not-white you have to stretch your suspense of disbelief into believing that an alien dinasty was planted in a country (even though there's a long line of monarchs from cintra).
On the other hand, in lord of the rings there's basically no reason for everyone to be white, rohan could be basically mongolia and noone would bat an eye today. But that world was created in a different way than 'so, basically north is north and south is south in the european view but countries don't make much sense because I'm a drunkard and I don't really care.'

The issue with pandering (you can ignore me tho, white cis man here) is that it breaks worldbuilding. Sometimes it doesn't matter, nobody said that elves have to be all white, the light/dark elves dichotomy describes moral alignment more than anything else, races don't have to be white, but if you do worldbuilding that locks you out of certain races (as i touched on the  'we're totally medieval scandivania, we're just called some random name' thing) you can't randomly change it, or change just a few important characters to be of color in an uniform society.",1
DuesCataclysmos,"Yes there absolutely is? I don't understand the fallacy that ""because there are fantasy elements, you are not allowed to draw from reality"". 

You are saying that because there are dragons, there is no real real reason for there to be no white characters in works like ATLA? I can think of two:

1) It's their setting.

2) It suits the setting.

the_lonely_creeper,"It might not seem obvious, but old villages in the M. Ages (which is what the stereotypical fantasy setting looks like) weren't exactly ""racially diverse"" in the modern sense. They might have had several different ethnic groups and languages, of course, but that doesn't mean that those ethnic groups were from random parts of the world. 

So any black or asian person in a European village would stand out (and vice-versa, adjust as required for your setting). 

To give you a sense of how much such people stand out, consider that even today, in most of the old world, people of a different race are an oddity, to the point that here in Greece, having the black kid of a children's group nicknamed ""μαύρος"", (mauros), meaning ""black"", is entirely possible, since chances are nobody in the group, including the black kid, know any other dark-skinned people outside the child's family.

There are varying cultures for each group across the medieval period. I feel that if I pick the wrong one to base a culture off of that could be viewed as racist. Lunda and Rwanda still had huts while Somalia was building castles and other masonry. If I want to base a warrior culture of King Shaka, it would be seen as creating a group of warring savages and putting a group down, even though Shaka had a profound impact on warfare, including his tactics being used to beat the superior tech of the British at the time.

PoignantBullshit,"Many fantasy novels are set in a medieval European setting, and as such should be constrained by the material realities of the time period. I don't think people realize how hard travel is without modern traversal methods. For example, it took almost 5 years for Marco Polo to travel from Europe to China. Travel is not easy. the diversity we see in the modern world would have been impossible without the modern mean of travel we now take for granted. As such sometimes there is a real reason why certain fantasy worlds can't match our contemporary levels of diversity. A fantasy world is a world that operates by fantastical rules, yet it doesn't mean that the rules of our world automatically just seize to exist. Unless you can ride it, the existence of Dragons won't alter just how hard travel was, or the fact that it was something to be enjoyed by a very small group of people, who were often very priviliged. For the vast majority of people throughout history they lived and died in the place that they were born, and rarely left it.

You can make diversity make sense of course. Magical means of travel, having a character be a traveler from a far off nation, have a large empire that facilitates travel or do something like the Elder Scrolls, where a bunch of different people that were previously geographically isolated has essentially all immigrated to the same continent and now live side by side. But if you base a setting on medieval western Europe, and then have every other character be a non-white person without ever giving a reason for why this is the case then it's going to be weird, for the same reason it would be weird in an Asian-inspired setting to have every other person be a white person without sufficient explanation.

Or you aren't reading enough and or in the right places. 

Through the escape of literature, Fantasy and Science Fiction especially, has taught me to see and love the diversity around me. I've fought for the freedom of whole peoples and species, waged countless wars on behalf of the down trodden and oppressed, and faced countless evils to protect people's of all race, species, creed, or sex behind the pages of a myriad of novels. And that's all just in fiction. Ffs, Fantasy was my first foray into gay and lesbian culture and got me normalized to the idea, I am an hard set ally to LGBTQIA community and that is in great part due to the rock solid foundation for the definition of love that Fantasy and Sci Fi helped create in my heart, mind, and soul. Or you even look at Nichelle Nichols and her role in the OG Star Trek, and how important that was for African Americans to see one of their own on the bridge of a god damned starship. Everyone knows the story about her and MLK. It's beautiful. 

So iunno, OP, maybe there are some shitty authors or creators out there, and definitely shitty fans, who have a way of bending things and making them disingenuous themselves.

Sch3ffel,"""If a fictional universe has dragons and magic in it, there's no real reason it can't also have black people or Asian people in it.""

i agree... but (nothing good ever comes after a but, but whatever...) technically speaking if an author doesnt explicitly states the features of a character, is because it's open for the reader to visualize the character face as whatever would feel more realistic for the reader combined with what would make sense in the setting of the fictional world.

being brief, a medieval fantasy setting like the witcher or forgotten realms where mobility (the hability to travel from place to place) is hard, it will seem very unlikely a diverse population to exist save from big city centers and port cities (places where trade and commerce are big motivators to travel), but a modern fantasy world like the movie bright and shadowrun, where mobility is easier it does totaly makes sense for a multiethinic population to exists regarless of the size of the urban center.

there is also the midway point, wich usually shows up at eastern media wich is the ""lo-fi fantasy"" or ""convinience medieval"" or ""soft medieval fantasy"" where besides the setting being basically medieval in nature (city cuilding and combat) there is suprisingly ease of mobility and sometimes even some techonological elements mixed in with magic, wich then there is basically no reason why a character shouldnt be <insert ethinic group here>... this setting is very common in JRPG's and usually, unless the story doesnt say otherwise, pretty diverse even.",1

There are so many legends and folk tales around that... Cernoknaznik, commonly translated into English as 'sorcerer' (but it's actually derived from 'black priest') is such a cool villains. They keep dragons as pets, ride them, or command them to burn whole towns... Fireballs? Tch.  If a cernoknaznik gets pissed off, he'll grab anything at hand and turn it into something badass.

Actually, a story where the Shinto mythology is absolutely correct for everyone, and some inner-city gang bangers get to come to terms with that would be kind of a fun ride. Culture-clash, the novel.

The Wolf Nomads are Baklunish with heavy Flan admixture. Baklunish hair is usually straight, dark, and very fine, and their eyes tend toward green. They have long limbs and facial features, with high cheekbones.

  
Flannae. These are the aboriginal inhabitants of the Flanaess, their bronze skin ranges from a lighter coppery hue to deep brown. Their hair tends to be wavy or curly, and from black to brown. They have strong, broad faces and sturdy builds.

  
Oeridian. These people, the descendants of proud horse nomads from central Oerik, have olive or tan skin and any color of hair from honey-blonde to black. The Oeridians founded the mighty Great Kingdom and co-founded the kingdom of Keoland, so their influence on everything from language to culture in the Flanaess is considerable.

  
Olman. The Olman are a brown-skinned people found mainly in the tropics of Hepmonaland and the Amedio Jungle. Their hair is straight and black, and their eyes are very dark. They have high cheek bones and high-bridged noses.

  
Rhennee. The Rhennee have olive-toned skin like the Oeridians, but darker, curlier hair. They tend to be short, but wiry and strong. They are a very different people culturally, thought to have originated on another plane of existence. On Oerth, they exist culturally as nomadic river-dwellers aboard barges.

  
Suloise. The Suloise are pale, some nearly albino, with kinky or curly hair of blonde or red. They tend to be narrow and lean.

  
Touv. The Touv have dark brown or nearly black skin, straight or wavy black hair, and brown or startlingly blue eyes. They dwell in Hepmonaland, mostly to the south of the Olman lands.",1

Sometimesokayideas,"Monocultures in general always get me in scifi and fantasy. I can somewhat understand not focusing on it because your world building could get so cumbersome your plot struggles... 

I know this is a book subreddit but the most obvious examples are on television. Take star trek, multiple episodes about it in both TOS and TNG, humans multiformed and multitalented and typically are unique in that... because the alien of the day is X and rigid and today's deeper moral is about how diversity is good.

Diversity *IS* good, but maybe if writers wrote stories to include it in the first place we wouldn't focus on our differences and just enjoy all our differences together.

Another tv example that kills me despite how much I loved this underrated show specifically calls the trope out on this....and does it itself. Babylon 5...in season one had an episode highlighting the religions of each race. In b5 races=species, and each of the species they talk about in the show has been colonizing the galaxy for decades to centuries. Every species has 1 religion, including the minbari where like 1/3 their entire population has been devoted to religious study over the last 1000 years. The narns have been subjugated for centuries, 1 religion though different profits,  the centauri, the ones who have been oppressing the narns the whole time, are ALL (but 1) racist asshats (at least until later then 1 turns into a whole 2) with a pantheon of gods they dont take very seriously, and humanity, brand new to the galaxy.... gets highlighted for its diversity in the end.

I will say though, that I think diversity is interesting and makes for a better story, *when it makes sense in the world.* I'm not the biggest fan of fantasy, but I like sci-fi and I think it's great when diversity is used the right way. I've read a few stories where certain alien races are coded as certain ethnic groups in a way for prejudice to be explored. And it's not a book, but the original Star Trek did an incredible job of shocking the racial sensibilities of the time by having diversity that wasn't exactly addressed head on in the show (that I'm aware of) but that very fact, the fact that it was *unremarkable* in that universe for a black woman to be 2nd (or 3rd?) in command of a starship was incredible! And it made sense with the world building because the Earth was basically unified. It would have been ridiculous to have it any other way.",19
guardian_green,"This is a good take, but doesn't work for all fantasy.

In some realms there is mobility. IRL merchants and churches and rich people wanting ""exotic"" art/science/people, and of course political marriages and wars and whatnot resulted in a certain level of diversity; we had black nuns in the Castlevania era here. Over time (and in some realms it's not 3 thousand years but 20) geography stops mattering, you don't need mobility to be hyper, you can have it happen for a long time, genes mix and resurface, communities form... Plus if you have magic, you don't necessarily need technology for people to move around the whole realm. (And give it enough time and your average person in the story doesn't know why people have diverse looks unless there's an established education system where they learn.)

In some realms, geography doesn't matter and never did, because barely anyone is a native. And some races don't have the type of evolution you'd expect (Witcher comes to mind, because a certain type of fanboy loves to whine about the black elf in the current adaptation, despite both elves and humans being not local to the planet, and elves presumably not having evolution at all)

Then in some realms looks aren't different because of geography but because of magic, in the Warcraft novels that's how we got Nagas, but also that's probably why the three types of elves look different (other possible explanation is that some nobles looked different due to a random mutation, and political arrangements and inbreeding spread the different coloration over generations, I'm not sure if we ever had that explained properly, it was a long time ago)

And geography doesn't have to be spread out over continents. What if some live in a treetop society, some a few hundred metres below on the ground, and some mostly in caves? Then they can have the random mutation in their version of Ghengis Khan, or a magic accident-slash-fashion-fad, or celestial spawns, or tens of thousands of years of mobility, or their star system colliding with perpendicular dimensions, or any number of combinations of those and more...

TraderMoes,"Fully agreed. The existence of magic and monsters and fantasy elements shouldn't be an excuse for bad worldbuilding and characterization. The point of fantasy isn't that ""unreal things exist therefore nothing matters and consistency goes out the window."" It's that unreal things exist, so lets explore how they would affect and shape the world and what sort of stories this can lead to. Things like skin color will still be affected by genetics and geography, unless you specifically make it part of your worldbuilding that magic has altered such things. Now you can make your world very cosmopolitan, with many travelers that mean that there can be all races everywhere. But when most fantasies start out with poor peasants and farmers living in some rural and forgotten backwater, it only makes sense for them to be homogeneous.

But even more importantly, I think in most fantasy ""race,"" as we understand it, barely even exists as a concept. There's a reason why in Lord of the Rings or in DnD, race refers to species. Because when you have dragons and lizard people and goblins and stuff like that to serve as the potential ""out"" group, skin tone among humans stops being important. That's why commentary regarding racism in fantasy is typically centered around things like ostracized demihumans, nonhumans living in slums, fetishization of elves, etc. Through the lens of fantasy, they can tell stories that teach lessons about racism or sexism or other -isms without bringing real world examples and connotations into play.

The other one is when an author goes for a full-on rainbow of diversity but seems weirdly squeamish about having mixed people. Like without being funny, if you had a small medieval village and 10% of the population were black and 90% were white, and there was no racism angle keeping people apart, within a century or two you wouldn’t have distinct ethnicities and instead everyone would be on a scale of mixed ancestry.

When I was reading through Glen Cook's The Black Company, as well as currently in the Malazan books, there was a hugely diverse world and nothing seems out of place or weird in the slightest because of all the different places that things took place in, it just seemed natural that different types of people would come from different places. Especially with Malazan, the empire is insanely diverse and takes things from everyone they conquer to make the whole that much better and that makes sense on many different levels. 

I would probably be somewhat put off if it was obvious the writer just put in people that didn't have any reason to be there story and worldbuilding wise for no other reason other than being inclusive.

""In fact, the hero, even at this moment galloping towards the Vortex Plains, didn’t get involved in this kind of argument because they didn’t take it seriously but mainly because this particular hero was a heroine. A red-headed one. 

Now, there is a tendency at a point like this to look over one’s shoulder at the cover artist and start going on at length about leather, thighboots and naked blades. Words like ‘full’, ‘round’ and even ‘pert’ creep into the narrative, until the writer has to go and have a cold shower and a lie down. Which is all rather silly, because any woman setting out to make a living by the sword isn’t about to go around looking like something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialized buyer. 

Oh well, all right. The point that must be made is that although Herrena the Henna-Haired Harridan would look quite stunning after a good bath, a heavy-duty manicure, and the pick of the leather racks in Woo Hun Ling’s Oriental Exotica and Martial Aids on Heroes Street, she was currently quite sensibly dressed in light chain mail, soft boots, and a short sword. All right, maybe the boots were leather.
But not black. 

Riding with her were a number of swarthy men that will certainly be killed before too long anyway, so a description is probably not essential. There was absolutely nothing pert about any of them.

Getting off track maybe, but it’s strange to me how the Game of Thrones TV series added so many rape scenes that weren’t in the book. What’s the point? Who is that for? The one that comes to mind involves a woman being raped and then shown learning to enjoy it and fall in love with her rapist. Dedicating herself to him. The rape was never mentioned again. So many of these worlds just seem like excuses for their creators and fans to relish in their own excesses while being able to say, “But it’s just made up”

What I don't agree with is when live action adaptations suddenly change the race (or physical characteristics) of an established character just to appear ""diverse"" enough.

Why would you make Achilles suddenly black? Everyone who has ever read Iliad would know that he wasn't black.

At the same time, everyone who has ever read The Little Mermaid would know that she was described as white. Also, having a European background is important for Little Mermaid because her real goal was to attain a soul. She is described as an Undine. This is a very important part of the story that Disney removed even from the original animated series. Yes, there are mermaids in African mythologies but their background doesn't fit the story's moral. Mami Wata would seduce a man for sex, not to gain a soul and she would probably kill him if he refuses.

I do have the same feelings for suddenly making an established character LGBTQ just for some virality. If it doesn't add anything valuable to the story and doesn't make sense in the flow, it shouldn't be done.

Sadly, even if you explain this, woke people would say you're racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.

pinkycatcher,"> but a thing that many neckbeards will complain about when it happens under the guise of ""historical accuracy"" (hey neckbeards: just because it's a medieval-inspired fantasy novel doesn't mean it needs to adhere to your conception of the racial diversity of europe in the 1400s).


This is such a shitty take just so you can feel good about yourself. 

Racial diversity simply needs to make sense in the world itself, nobody is complaining that the *Stormlight* series is mostly people of mixed Asian origin, because each culture and group tends to look similar to each other and has cultural traits. 

People who are born and grow up in small towns that have very little access to the outside world (Hint: like 60% of characters in fantasy fit this trope) need to look similar and share similar characteristics or have a specific reason why that person is different (Rand in WoT is an example). 

Diversity is more about how easy travel is in the world, if it's hard to get somewhere, then you're less likely to be similar to someone who is there. If the world is a fantasy world, generally it's low technology and travel isn't as easy as hopping on the next flight and moving across borders without issue. If travel is easy (like from one town to the next) then you're more likely to look like those people, because your ancestors already likely interacted with them. 

So bad whitewashing is the Wheel of Time casting where Tam, Mat Perrin, and Nynaeve are all different races despite being from the same tiny ass village that literally has so little contact with the outside world that it's effectively not governed. 

Look, it'd be dumb is King T'challa was cast as a white character just as it'd be dumb if Thor were black (cough Heimdall cough). That's whitewashing. 

But it's not whitewashing to have a black King T'Challa and a white Thor in the same story. That's just diversity.

How have they not basically been bred out into the larger population? And if they're recent arrivals, then where did they come from? Or are the others so racist they won't breed with them? If so, how does that impact with world and its politics?' But honestly the Witcher books aren't very good, and don't put nearly that level of effort into world building. Ol' Andre instead uses different species to tell his story about the dangers of racism and bigotry. Hes survived more than his fair share of fascism.

Like imagine a normal stereotypical medieval fantasy. You’ve read about magic, horses and so on, then suddenly a horse gets described as “as big as a car”. It breaks the moment and sticks out like a sore thumb.

Same goes with referencing real world ethnic groups by name. Kinda kills the moment",2
Seeker1904,"I agree thoroughly. OPs take is so weird. Firstly very few fantasy worlds are a homogeneous single ethno-culture group and , secondly, there are many fantasy worlds and fantasy authors who are not white and who highlight diverse cultures.

champ999,"To be honest it's just safer and easier to write what you know and avoid too much that can dilute the story. For authors that want to build big worlds it makes a lot of sense to at least address different cultures and ethnicities, but it can be tricky to handle it in a way that's palatable for modern audiences. Like maybe I've been misled but racism was extremely rampant in the middle ages, especially in places that weren't trade hubs. It feels a bit like white knighting to make the MC just so enlightened to not be racist, while having a racist MC can make the MC quite repulsive and lead some readers to thinking the author is racist.",13
kchoze,"It would be more consistent if the physical aspects of people fits the history and geography of the culture being represented, but if that satisfies it, sure. The important thing is that it makes sense in-story. For example, when they announced the Doctor in Doctor Who would regenerate into a woman, I had no issue with that in itself because there is already a plot device within the story allowing for such a regeneration. A shame the first female Doctor couldn't have gotten a better run, but that's not because of the gender-swap.

I also have to point out, as you mentioned ""actors"", that I might understand why a televisual adaptation may not be able to keep 100% faithful to a book, because the logistics of finding actors to fill the roles is a difficulty that book writers do not have to deal with.",15
CarsomyrPlusSix,"Also very true.

Just lumping in all Europeans / those of European descent as a homogenous group is a phenomenon that for most of history would not parse as a coherent thought.

CarsomyrPlusSix,"Well in Lord of the Rings you have different species, even in the literal sense of not being able to crossbreed.

Which apparently isn't the case with elves and humans because IIRC Aragorn and Arwen had a kid, not sure if this is normally possible, only possible because she chose a mortal life, or because he's Dunedain, etc.  (I like the setting but I'm not an expert).  Humans being able to mate with anything is an odd but fairly consistent trope in fantasy / sci-fi, perhaps a lot of authors and audiences who need to go to horny jail? (Bonk!)

I suppose it's worth noting that the existence of other sapient species in your civilization or immediate outskirts would have interesting effects.  For one thing, while it is possible to have multiple prejudices simultaneously ""the other"" is more likely to be the the folks who aren't remotely the same type of thing you are, as opposed to just superficial demographics.  This concept amuses my curiosity, as it might facilitate a significant reduction of humans being racist to other humans because they can all agree to hate those damn gnomes.

And note, I'm not even talking about other species that are existential threats you can't possibly coexist with, like Tolkien's orcs.  The concept of having irrational fear or bigotry barely makes sense when ""the other"" are reavers; for a human, elf, dwarf

It really made me realize that plenty of racists share the same media I do and get completely different experiences out of it... and that not having explicitly negative views of other races doesn't necessarily make you not racist. So many people talked about the hermoine controversy by starting with ""im not racist but"" and then detailing how they disliked that a character historically portrayed as white being portrayed by a black person in a play was a bad thing and that pandering to black people by giving them representation in a fantasy setting that takes place in a country where there is a solid black population is... overdoing it?

If you have a story that's set in a world inspired by Japan you'd assume the people would look more or less ethnically japanese. If there was a single white dude who lived there, that guy would have to have an origin. Why is he different from everyone else? Is he a wandering merchant who came from far off lands? The son of a family of refugees from a different place? Is he the last of a people who used to live there and were driven off by the current inhabitants? Basically cultural homogeneity lets you believe the people have always been there and that it's as simple as that, but cultural diversity requires backstory. That backstory can be simple if the story is set in a trading hub town where it makes sense that far off travellers would come to, but it's weird if you've got a story set in a remote polish village and there's a black guy with no explanation of why he's there.

Racial diversity basically requires a relationship between a different set of cultures, because that's the only way it ever happens in our universe, so it feels unrealistic if it operates on different rules elsewhere.",10

When I said I think they should come from somewhere else, I don't mean that they shouldn't be from the region the story is set in. What I mean is that, it would feel equally strange to set a story in an Asian based world where everyone is Asian but have the protagonist be white and that just be part of it. That would be weird wouldn't it? To have a totally Asian setting and a cast of Asian characters but just one character is different for no reason with no mention of it or explanation?

If you have an area that, like the real world, is diverse and people of many races live there, awesome, no need to explain further. But if you've mapped out the whole land of your world and there is NOWHERE for these people to have come from, it's just a whole in the setting. 

As to the point about species, yes you are correct, people of color are CLEARLY not a different species. My point was that it feels like an oversight to go into so much depth about the origin of elves and orcs and whatever you'd like to choose, but then be like ""Oh yeah, black people? Pfft, they're just there"" in fact, I think it's quite the opposite of what you were implying about my statement. The Nords get their fully developed and fleshed out kingdom. The elves do to. So do the orcs. So do the dwarves. Everyone gets their own culture and development. But black people? Nah fuck em. Just throw them in with the white people because humans are humans and fuck having a complex and developed sense of a human nation with various races, ethnicities and cultures.

EAS893,"""When you just randomly splash all possible ethnicities around, it looks weird, unrealistic, and pander-ey."" 

There are story ways to make something like that make sense.

One of my favorite examples is the world Matt Coleville uses for his homebrew DnD campaigns.  In his world, there was an ancient civilization that conquered most of the world, and they wanted to make sure people in future generations were loyal to the empire first and not to their own ethnic group, so they intentionally forcibly resettled populations of people in such a way that the empire became racially diverse.

You get mostly white characters when reading stories in a setting that is derived from a predominantly white society, e.g. medieval Europe or the fantasy equivalent.

When I read a work set in medieval Japan and written by a Japanese author, no surprise, all the characters are Japanese.

When I read works by Chinese authors, they mostly contain Chinese characters, or derivatives of, and have a lot of references to Chinese social values.

The books I am currently reading don’t really specify ethnicity, but the descriptions and social values of the characters bring to mind Chinese social values more than American social values.

Perhaps the issue is that you are only reading from one narrow set of American authors rather than diversifying your reading habits.",124
Fair_University,"That's just the thing though - I can't. Do you have any example of other series where everyone is white? Every high fantasy series I've read has ***tons*** of Black and asian cultures. This is just off the top of my head

**Wheel of Time -** tons of asian style cultures and main characters. Lan and the borderlanders are clearly asian. The Emond's Fielders are all dark skinned. Multiple other nations (tarabon, arad doman) are middle eastern. Rand stands out precisely because he's tall and white.

**Malazan -** Race is rarely even mentioned, but honestly there are probably more black and brown characters than white. Kellanved is black, Laseen is blue (lol), half of the Bridgeburners and Bonehunters are black.

**Stormlight -** Most of the characters are middle eastern in appearance. Class is determined by eye color.

**Mistborn -** The Terris are all dark skinned

**Monarchies of God -** The Merduks are supposed to be a proxy for Middle Easterners.

**ASOIAF -** Free Cities is supposed to the near east/Mediterranean, Dothraki are Mongolians, Yi Ti is Chinese/Japanese.

**Kingkiller -** Multiple ""olive skinned"" races.

**Chronicles of Narnia -** Noteworthy because the world is specifically absent of humans. The Calormenes/Tashbaan are a middle eastern/arabic culture, although mostly portrayed as an evil culture. 

**Harry Potter -**  Set in the Modern UK.

Stormypwns,"I don't know where else in this thread to ask this question, so I guess I'll try to get your opinion on it, since you seem to be a big fan of diversity:

As a writer, at what point when writing ethnic characters and cultures do I start to 'culturally appropriate'? Even if not culturally appropriating, at what point do I get blamed for misrepresenting a similar real life culture?

I'm currently co-writing an urban fantasy book with a few friends. I'm the only one who doesn't currently have any ethnic characters because I'm not sure that I could do them justice. 
The setting, for example, takes place in a fictional town near where I live; reason being that I can write accurately about what it is like to live here. I don't really want to write anything that I don't have a firm understanding of, so I'm probably not going to feel comfortable writing, say, a Chinese character until I've lived with a Chinese family for or few years. You see what I'm saying?

But when you base classes on particular characteristics, and don't really penalize lack of other characteristics, you tend to create a general effect of pigeon-holing a race which has the characteristics that play to those strategies. Dwarf fighter, elf mage, halfling thief, etc. People usually want to do the best they can, and having if a race/class combo works, then in general they will gravitate to that combo. 

I do both. If it's a short or weekend campaign, I'm going to min-max the shit out of it. Longer campaign? How about a young human fighter who lost his family and farm to raiding orcs, and killed them using the only weapons and defensive items he had available, two cast iron pans.

Romance is not objectively a worse genre that spy fiction but if you take a popular spy fiction series and, in an attempt to broaden your fan base, start inserting so much romance that it warps the story then fans will start dropping away and claiming that ""romance is as valid as spy fiction"" or justifying it by pointing out how it's the natural direction of the plot won't make a difference because it misses the point.",41

LotR is the end of the third age, for reference. My best guess for what stories they plan to tell is the fall of Numenor and the forging of the rings of power. 

I think I heard they have rights to at least pieces of the Book of Lost Tales because the map they released a while ago is only found in that book, and now the trees show they have at least pieces of the Silmarillion.

For example, if an Author introduced a character named Wěi Zhang, I'll probably assume it would be a character that fantasy race would correspond to our real life China. There are a lot of unique names in Slavic, India, Asian, etc that haven't been borrowed from other cultures.

The problem with this technique is that it pidgeon-holds you into using (what some would call) stereotypical names. Some would call them stereotypical names, but that would be like saying Smith was a stereotypical English name. It might be a very common name, but I believe we're abusing the definition of stereotype in this situation. Muhammad is the most common Muslim name in the world, I wouldn't call a Muslim named Muhammad a stereotype because of their name anymore than I would call a white person named John Smith a stereotype.

So, in short, this method doesn't help if you wanted to name your Asian character May or something, since May has been used as a name across many cultures, but it would helpful as a quick way to add diversity for when you're at a point in a story when taking time to fully describe someone may bog down the pacing of the story.",36

People of different races living together on the other hand are something that is real, and we know how it happens (human migration from one place to another distant location). Because it's a real thing and we know how it works, it feels more unrealistic to have a single black family in a polish inspired village than it does for a dragon to attack that same village.

nostripeszebra,">You're conflating realism with internal justification. The reason for the presence of dragons in fantasy worlds is generally explained, even if it's just ""they exist and they're native to the land"" or ""they came from a different place"". It's not comparable to multiracial human societies because that requires widespread migration and intermixing of people with ancestry from wildly different climates, which is rarely explained in fantasy. Different races of humans suggests multiple continents that are in contact and allow for active mass migration. Regardless of how the characters are physically depicted, the settings tend to be coded as standard, homogenous European medieval fantasy realms - the cultural, social and political impacts of a modern Western standard of multiculturalism being injected into that tends to be ignored.

No I'm not. You just seem to think you can explain away fucking dragons with one sentence and be fined but with humans and a different color we have to go into deep details about migration patterns in a completely made up fantasy world.

Literally half of the problems that go on in that series are because one power-hungry man-hating woman gets into a PTA war with another woman who's a frigid bitch and their organization spends the next 10 books engaged in a cold war of decorum and principles without ever doing anything good, and one of the main players in the conflict who was previously a bad-ass strong role model ends up a meek, helpless little damsel who is ""fixed"" by falling in love with a man who has authority over her. It's fucking gross.

The fact that they basically made any woman who was powerful seem like an outright enemy of everyone by conditioning them to hate all men makes for a rather overt bit of literary conditioning in retrospect. If a woman has magic, she will inherently attempt to suppress any men with magic, and through their man-hating society they cause myriad problems the world over by working against the main character, who happens to be a man with magic, who spends the whole series moping about what a burden it is to be him without actually doing anything worth mentioning beyond sitting around in palaces and brooding.

DomLite,"To be fair, I love all the various diverse and amazing characters that Marvel has introduced, but I also feel like they shot themselves in the foot a little bit by being so ham-fisted about it. Like, they introduced POC/LGBT/Opposite gender replacements or sidekicks for pretty much their entire main lineup of heroes within six months, and these characters came out of nowhere. They'd have been better served to introduce them to the story, make them regular appearances, slowly work them into the mythos as new heroes, then have them step into bigger roles in a more staggered fashion. Miles Morales was done wonderfully, but as soon as he took over as Ultimate Spider-Man, it was like the next month that Riri Williams stepped in as Ironheart to replace Iron Man, even as short-lived as that was. It made it incredibly obvious that it was a hatchet job to try and diversify the cast as quickly as possible with as little time committed to doing it. If anything I feel like they sold these characters short by chucking them straight at the wall in hopes that they'd stick instead of giving them more time to establish themselves as people first, rather than tokens.

In the end, they've all grown and matured as characters since, and I love having them around, but their initial intro was incredibly sloppy, and the swift manner in which all of them were introduced made it plain to anyone with eyes that Marvel was just dumping out a bag of token POC characters to take over headline titles and going ""SEE?! WE'RE SUPER DIVERSE!"" I love that they've managed to make those same characters into their own fantastic people since, and given almost all of them their own solo series to shine in, but their initial rollout was just poorly handled.

ReallyGuysImCool,"Hey, thanks for being brave enough to ask. I wasn't going to respond to any more messages because there's a lot of ignorance going on in the sense that there's no room for subtlety - people here are clearly feeling attacked and lashing out at any suggestion that the quality of representation still has a long way to go. 

But that leads into my first response to what you're saying - I am as you put it, a 'fan of diversity' (ha) but not every story has to have diversity to be good. You can absolutely tell a killer story that doesn't put others down just because they're all one race. Most reasonable 'diversity fans' understand and accept this, as well as, um, non diversity fans. 

The second response that comes to mind would be that if you do choose to write characters of other ethnicities, respect is the most important thing - boiling a character down soley to the features of their race or serve as flavor is tricky and most likely veers into disrespectful. This is something 'non-diversity fans' have trouble accepting. Even if you don't know anything about Chinese food or Chinese language - you can still have a Chinese American person in your story who has human conflicts and desires and feelings that are outside of being Chinese. I think you're onto something that it would be worse to Google 'Chinese customs' and base your character entirely off that, and you'd be better off just leaving them out at that point.

Not like...a new character that has their own past alias, personality, and origin. Just literally make a mention of ""my name is Victoria Stone but my friends call me Victor. Blah blah blah . Booyah. And so forth and so on."" (Essentially cobbling the characters personality on a different body, and then moving forward building that character as they see fit going forwards)

It would leave people asking why? Why did you need to change THAT character and not just make a new character with their own story and personality and interests? 
 
So it just goes back and forth, where people don't understand why you wouldn't WANT detailed characters with their own back story and motivations and interests that feels more realistic and fleshed out. It feels like people simply want to ""take away"" (as if it matters what ethnicity the person is. if theyre relatable to your life in any way then what does it matter) the relatability of the character to ""your people"" just to be petty. Just because they ""don't like you as a race/gender.""

What I don't get is when people get upset when people dress up as a character they love and they aren't the characters ethnicity that people need to interject that you aren't allowed to do that. I just like the character, why can't I show it? It's a lot less common recently, but I saw it a lot only a couple years prior.

SelectCattle,"Oh, on that point I have to disagree with you. I don’t think you can blame the author for the decisions of the casting agent. Or the biases of the reader. The author usually has very little control over his or her work once it’s published.  There’s no reason at all that Geralt cannot be a non-white character.

The reason he is has much more to do with marketing. Unfortunately humans relate more closely with members of their own race. If you want a film to play well in the United States and Europe, where a lot of the money is, casting a white Persian as a character is a means to that end. “White washing.”  They do the same thing for China. It’s not an accident that the main characters in The Meg were white and Chinese— they wanted the movie to play well in those markets.  

The answer, of course, is the deal for size the importance of race and human affairs. But a lot of people are very uncomfortable with that.",16
RedditSuxAWholeLot,"> Loads of fantasy stories are not based in a universe with homo sapiens evolving and adapting to local conditions over a couple million years of migration.

They're still ""humans"" aren't they? If they're not humans as we understand them then it needs an explanation. 

>The idea that some alternate reality evolved European-like humans is no less silly than there existing a genetically diverse population.

I think it's certainly more silly. How do you get a genetically diverse population in Medieval Korea? Women in Korea give birth to children of different races at random? Otherwise you would need a super contrived scenario for something like that to make sense.

I think in fantasy it's expected that things like biology and physics are the same as on earth unless stated otherwise.",4
Fox-and-Sons,"Sure, and if someone wants to do a story like that that's totally fine. If someone wants to create a story that's a little more loose with the realism in regard to ethnicity that's great, for example I'm stoked to see the Green Knight. It's a totally valid choice. It's just weird to me to act like authors have some obligation to avoid realism in one area just because they weren't realistic in another.",2
CoBr2,"Well yeah, because we don't live in a world that has ever had dragons, but we do live in a world that had medieval technology at one point, and we know that migration and seeing other races were both super fucking rare when medieval technology was around.

Don't get me wrong, there are valid ways to do this and reasons to do it, but medieval cultures were homogenous and so people are going to assume medieval settings are homogenous unless you explain otherwise. It's why lots of modern fantasy specifically talks about magic for transportation/travel. Allows you to include people from various continents/climates/races.",8
Tidwell-,"I'm not sure why you are comparing fantasy elements to non-fantasy elements. If an iPhone popped up in a fantasy novel, I'm not just gonna say ""well dragons exist, why not iPhones?""

An author trying to force feed us Earthan races is a bit similar, albeit not as extreme. ""Fair"" skin and ""dark"" skin are the dominate ""races"" in fantasy because they're generic, and both would very likely exist in any setting with cold and warm climates. Everything else specific to Earth likely wouldn't. I'm taken out of a story a bit when an author tries realllly hard to describe a specific race without using the word. ""Oh... so this dude is Chinese, but not Chinese. Is there a whole China-clone country somewhere nearby? Should I expect them to have all the same customs? What dynasty?""

It's not an anti-anything-not-white thing. I'd feel the same way if an author described a character as ""The man atop the horse was fair skin, with a unique drawl in his speech, wearing a big round hat.""

It's lazy writing and un-immersive.",18
yohahn_12,"There is definitely some conflation of the two happening here, the prior poster just used a very poor example. While sure, you could just say ""they came from a different place"", but without further context that is very poor world building, and applies equally to *either* people or dragons. (Being generous perhaps they were trying to be brief, and meant an unknown and/or unreachable place eg. another world)

Of course..  migration is possible,  different ethnic groups would be less common, or you could always actually design a setting that has reasons for greater prevalence of ethnic and cultural mixes. It could simply be down geography; an easy real world analogy is areas around Asia Minor and the Mediterranean.

The author goes into detail on the nostalgic 80's references, but it just feels forced into the story instead of naturally occurring like it did in RP1.

RP1 took me on a fun adventure of a rags to riches story with action and mystery while being set in a fun gaming fantasy world that any 80's baby could appreciate.

RP2 did none of this at all.

I dono, I am horrible at writing reviews for some reason.... Sorry

&#x200B;

\*\*Edit\*\* - Just for kicks I went and did a quick search of google reviews and found this one to hit the mark. Credit to **Ryan Wilkins - 6 months ago**:  


I bought the book off of the back of the first which I thought was brilliant. A great look back on 80s pop culture, pulled forward to futuristic setting.  
  
The second book, however, I found a chore to read. So much so that I’ve still not finished it, and have no real desire to pick it up again.  
  
The biggest issue is that it’s just an almost word for word rehash of the first book. You never feel like there’s anything particularly exciting around the corner. It’s a very slow plod through the same story.  
  
The other issue I have with it, I’ll try and deal with as sensitively as possible. Cline has obviously decided, since writing his first book, that he wants to bring in more “liberal” views which is absolutely fine. The way he does this, however, is very clumsy. Firstly, the main character has now become a total arse. No reason is given for this except he has decided that, as a white man, he should be. He’s also now bisexual even though he’s infatuated by the same woman he was infatuated with before. We also have a new cast of racially diverse characters who seem to be shunted in, without any real thought other than that to show that they’re there. And then we get to Halliday who, having not had a bad word spoken about him in the previous book, is a racist, misogynistic sexual predator who is unrelenting in getting what he wants. Odd that this was never mentioned before, considering how well the characters were supposed to know the man and all the evidence being freely available.  
  
Now there’s not necessarily anything wrong with anything above, except it doesn’t feel at place with the same characters. It just all feels.... forced. I don’t think this was the original story arc the writer wanted to take, but took it in the wake of the recent movements across the west. If he had have wanted to go this way, why not create a simultaneous cast, with new backgrounds, exploring this universe with a different view of it? Make the main character be that person. Black. Gay. Disabled. Whatever. But give them their back story carved that way from the start. Don’t demote these people to an afterthought.  
  
So, in summary; this book is incredibly beige. No new ideas and a serious lack of direction of character and storyline.   
  
Give it a miss.",1

Lexilogical,"Let me explain it from a money perspective then.

Let's draw up a completely fictional, hypothetical scenario so I don't need to source myself.   Comic book company Darcel has been chugging along, turning out comics since the early 30's, with great success.  Their best selling titles involve Wonderman, Catboy and Captain Amazing.

However, they've reached the early 2000's and realized that their sales are starting to decline.  Market research suggests that the biggest issue is a change in society.  Their normal market, teenaged, middle-class, white boys, is actually taking up a smaller portion of the teenaged market, and Wonderman and Catboy both very much appeal to that market.  But they appeal less to teenagers of colour because the stories just highlight the inequalities in their life, and appeal even less to teenaged girls, because the storylines are very boy-oriented.

So what is Darcel to do?  Well, they could start a whole new line of comics.  And they do that.  New characters and new heroes have been coming out since the 30's, that's nothing new.  But the new stories and comics just don't have the same market pull as Wonderman and Catboy.  They don't have 90 years worth of marketing behind them.  If those stories are pulling in thousands each month, the new, stories, aimed at a market they haven't been reaching to, has maybe tens of fans/dollars attached.

So then they look at Captain Amazing.  Technically, this character has always been male.  But, the gender isn't baked into the marketing like Wonderman or Catboy.  And while this story is still popular, it isn't as popular as the other two.  If they gender and/or race swap them, they have a chance to grab a huge, NEW portion of the market, as well as a chance to leverage the 90 years worth of loyal fandom and back story to help them break into the market.  And with all of these stories, the fans are already use to frequent change over in the continuity.  Why, just 5 years ago, they broke the multi universe again and Catboy died....

And really, the story almost always makes (comic book) sense for why this character is different now.  The loyal fandom isn't getting screwed over, they know why Captain Amazing has died.  He had to save his true love, by infusing her with his power as the universe collapsed around them....

Really, the only people who ever get super upset are the people who never really read the comics in the first place, and they won't shut up about how Captain Amazing is a black woman now.  It's free publicity!",4
Reformedjerk,"A big part of the reason is that there are many many more white male characters than minority or female characters.

This is why it's so weird to see black people walk around in medieval European armor. Medieval Europe didn't have black people, and even in fantasies, the world is usually divided between monarchies, the rulers of which don't like mass immigration of different looking people from different cultures, with possibly different religions, people which the uneducated masses dislike even more. And Witcher even has a canonical region, Zerrikania, populated by dark-skinned people.

What would have been interesting even from Sapkowski, is to have the Conjunction of the Spheres mix different looking people from different cultures and drop them into a hostile world where they have to work together to survive despite their prejudice towards each other.

SapTheSapient,">They're still ""humans"" aren't they? If they're not humans as we understand them then it needs an explanation.

If humans, as we know them, without the biologic and geologic history that made humans possible, you can have no expectations on minor local genetic variation.  

>I think it's certainly more silly. How do you get a genetically diverse population in Medieval Korea? Women in Korea give birth to children of different races at random? Otherwise you would need a super contrived scenario for something like that to make sense.

Sure, if your fiction is set in Medieval Korea, then you would expect the people to be Korean.  But if your fiction is set in Dorden Prime, the Dordenians can have a broader genetic diversity.  That doesn't mean that people are giving birth to unrelated children.  It means the population is just more genetically broad than what you personally might be thinking.  In Medieval Brittan, red, brown, blond, and black hair was all common enough.  People were not just clones of each other.  Hair color diversity is just the result of variation of genetic characteristics that had long been in the population.  Now imagine a world where that kind of diversity also exists in skin color, etc.  

If you can imagine a fictional world where events somehow conspired to replicate Medieval Korea, somehow converging on the same genetics without having the billions of years of real world happenstance that created it, you can imagine a world where evolution/creator gods/crashed spaceship/etc resulted in a local population that is slightly more genetically diverse than what you are used to.",4
SapTheSapient,"The point is, given a completely different biologic and historic history, the genetic clumping we have in the real world would be completely unrealistic.  What you are calling ""realism"" is really the unjustified superimposition of real world happenstance on a fantasy world for the ease and comfort of the author/reader.  

Surely the typical fantasy writer isn't working through mutation rates and population dispersion to estimate a ""realistic"" level of genetic diversity in a given population.  They are mostly just dumping familiar ideas into their settings.  There are totally valid reasons to, say, dig deep into a certain mythology, but ""realism"" has nothing to do with it.

And if that's the case and travel between these places is commonplace enough that a place can achieve a modern standard of ethnic diversity, those other places need to be relevant in the setting.

Humans of different races *have* to have originated from different parts of the world though, because that's what causes ""races"".

The fact that you think dragons Coexisting with humans is more plausible than humans living with other humans of a different color is crazy to me.

BabePigInTheCity2,"> When migrations happen, people don't just integrate into the society instantly and go do whatever they please. 

You’d be surprised how quickly people adapt to one another’s presences.  And it’s not just a question if integration there is change on both ends.  A city like medieval Constantinople reflected the fact that it was a meeting point for a wide variety of cultures, people neither fully acculturated and integrated, nor existed fully outside of the Greek majority.

> When a traveler looks for a job in a distant kingdom, he should probably have some unique reason for doing so. 

That’s just decent character writing though.  No character should be doing things just for the sake of it.  That doesn’t mean that you need to go to extra lengths to justify the existence of people of color in a fantasy setting.

> If you are going to have diverse set of characters, do it right. Diversity is more than skin color and exotic names.

> Having random diverse characters just for the sake of it doesn't really do anything other than make the world less consistant.

To that point, I have to wonder how much this really means.  I like fantasy quite a bit, but it is a genre that is *full* of schlock, and shit character development and writing, and plot contrivances that put people in improbable places at improbable times.  I feel that it is very telling that people get so uniquely riled up about brown characters not having a ton of text dedicated to justifying their presence.

There are very well addressed racial themes too, though it takes the shape of Eye Color first before going into Alethi (the Polynesian type) against Parshendi (a race that has carapace that is black, red, and white marbled - and they also change their forms so gender is addressed within that too!) 

(Stealth edit: There are also a few gay characters! One quote says one of the gay characters is more manly cause he wants to sleep with men, so they definitely don't go stereotypical with it.)

Think the Silk road, Chinese goods made it to the Vikings, but that doesn't mean it was a common occurrence nor does it mean you'd see lots of Chinese traders in Norway. A trader doesn't have to go from point A to point Z to get goods that far, they only have to go to point B, then someone else takes it from there and goes to point C and so on and so on.

dutchwonder,"Well, historically what has happened is that they would trade durable goods one trip over whether by land or boat. Thus trade goods could travel far while the people carrying those trade goods kept to their short stint of the route.

Condomonium,"My guy, these people are travelling by horseback, carriages, and walking. They don't have highways, cars, and planes so there is not much ""mixing"" because people literally just cannot go that far realistically(both due to distance as well as it just being expensive and difficult). Most societies in fantasy worlds are homogenous *because* medieval cities and villages were homogenous. The problem is you would need to cover a vast area if you want to have every color of the spectrum because travel was very limiting. It surely is possible, if you set it up correctly, considering Rome was an incredibly diverse civilization; but Rome was far from the norm for most areas and was literally the cultural hub of a millennium long kingdom/republic/empire.",17
pinkycatcher,">such a process is extremely slow

Yes, but given a fantasy world you can extend history back thousands of years because generally these worlds haven't seen development. So if travel is easy, say there are portals every 20 miles that can take you anywhere, then you need a reason why that homogenization hasn't happened to some major extent. 

Extremely slow is still very fast on a historical timeline. Intermingling can happen over a few hundred years which is nothing. This means you need to have some sort reason why this hasn't happened, either massive racism, inability to interbreed (more common with other races like elves, dwarves, etc.), or your society needs to have advanced to fast travel relatively recently.

On the other hand, given no development, it's more likely travel is hard, which means you need to justify diversity in regions or else it simply doesn't make sense, you can't have a town of 200 people with one black family that's native to the area without lots of incest or some reason they're the only black family.",1

TheStabbyBrit,"Because diversity is unrealistic.

Americans like to talk about ""white"" people and ""black"" people, but neither of these exist. Look at the ethnic maps of Europe and Africa. The former especially is telling because the modern national borders correlate strongly with the ethnic spread of people. Africa and the Middle East were the same until they were carved up artificially by European empires.

The other major exception is China, but if you view China as a Mandarin empire, it suddenly makes sense. After all, Britain covered 1/3rd of the globe at one point, yet we consider the 'British' to only come from one tiny island.

So, why do nations map so accurately to ethnic groups? Mostly because the things that discourage diversity also discourage spreading your borders. Mountains and large bodies of water make great barriers to both political dominion and ethnic diversity. If your fantasy world does not have a way to trivialise crossing these barriers, an ethnostate *will* form wherever those barriers form a natural partition of land.

If no such barriers exist, and your fantasy world follows the same basic rules as the real world, one of two things will happen; competing ethnicities will intermix into a single ethnic group (at which point, go back to Step One and repeat for this new ethnostate), or you will get something like the African ethnic map - a tangled mess where distinct pockets of ethnicity form enclaves, surrounded by other ethnicities. Expect a lot of violence and misery here.

The kind of modern 'multiculturalism' can only exist in a setting that allow rapid travel between locations, and has an incentive for cultures to intermix. After all, being able to teleport to the other side of the continent in the blink of an eye doesn't mean you don't hate the people who live there.",20
Rhawk187,"Fundamentally, I agree, I wouldn't think it's necessarily pandering if you had a world that follow our expectations of Mendelian genetics or evolution by natural selection.

Why not green people with chlorophyic pigments in the skin, and cyanin pigments, etc.?  I feel like it usually comes down to the psychology of the reader rather than anything internal to the story, which feels like a bit of a shame from an art perspective.

But if you are following the rules of Earth-like sexual reproduction, then regional homogony does make sense for worlds where travelling is less probable, and when you do improbable things they need a reason, and if you can't give a good reason, then it feels like a personal agenda, and that's when you get accused of ""pandering"".",20

If it was indeed Captain Amazings true love then the assumption is that they are in fact different people. Hell even the idea of multiverse forms being different is common and more or less accepted now. Its different that miles morales is spiderman in a universe seperate from the original universe and we can now expand on that universe which is great. What I am saying is in this example if spider man was peter parker, but they just decided ""well no one said that spiderman/peter parker HAD to be Caucasian, so we've swapped the characters ethnicity. Deal with it."" It doesn't happen often which is why I don't get people's reasons for getting upset. Short of just straight up remaking a work and stealing the original characters alias and just rebranding them as a different gender/race/etc. without at the very least giving a REASON as to why or how that new person is an alternate universe or just a different person then I don't see the problem. If it's alternate universe peter parker and they were Hispanic, cool. If miles morales is himself a completely different spiderman from Peter parker cool. If you just randomly swapped the person up without any explanation then I would see that as not cool, but honestly how often does that even happen?

I don't know enough comic book characters to even speculate on that, I think the only example that I can think of that's somewhat this happening was the Ghostbusters remake where they gave the same last names as the original characters and just told people confused as to why they couldn't be a different crew of people with different names as to not confuse them with the originals that they can just essentially ""deal with it and stop being mysoginistic"" when it has nothing to do with hating women (although for some Im sure it was, some people are clearly angry hateful and just can't be swayed), but rather that it has to do with not copying the character in such a way as to confuse the original work with the remake.

Replacing the character 1:1 like this sends a different message in my opinion. Less of ""we need to do the right thing, and accept people of all colors, genders and cultures because that's what the heroes we grew up loving is doing"" it would feel more akin to ""You're disliked as you are. Everyone would rather you be something you're not. If they could change you, they would. Not even heroes that look like you are good enough."" I'm not gonna lie, I feel like there are people who are rightfully angry about the state of the world that would be happy to send that message as a clear cut ""we're fucking tired of you"" to white cis men out of sheer anger and frustration. I personally don't think being hateful out of spite will ever get us anywhere. Whether or not that's the message intended is up to interpretation, but that's how it feels, and if people of color, and people of different genders would like careless cis men to  take into consideration the feelings of others other than themselves for once, then the sentiment should be extend in kind.",11

...Why? Aside from this not being a minor local genetic variation (I'm curious what you'd consider major if literal different races are minor) What can you have expectations on as far as human biology goes?

You might as well say you can't have expectations on physics either. Maybe the speed of light fluctuates or sometimes gravity is much stronger or weaker on certain areas of the planet. You can't expect people to just take things like that in stride. Divergences need explanations.

>the Dordenians can have a broader genetic diversity.

You are conflating genetic diversity and ethnic/racial diversity. They are different things. You *cannot* have a racially diverse civilization exist unless the diversity is historically brand new or there are extremely strict laws/taboos against interbreeding.

>In Medieval Brittan, red, brown, blond, and black hair was all common enough.

Yes, because those are mostly recessive alleles which allowed the corresponding phenotypes to be expressed in the relative absence of a dominant phenotype (black hair). If you equally mixed in black haired people then eventually everyone would just have brown/black hair.

>that is slightly more genetically diverse than what you are used to.

You are mis-using genetic diversity as a concept. More genetic diversity is exactly what would make such a situation impossible. The type of society you are describing would quickly result in the population just having people with mildly different shades of brown skin/hair/eye color.  

It would **not** be black people and white people and asian people and native american people and arab people all living together while still being racially distinct.

I get what you're saying, but basically just boils down to the same fallacy of ""Hey, you got wizards and dragons and shit so therefore nothing has to make sense at all.""

For anyone who doesn't know, the pony express was effectively a horse relay network that would allow a person to ride at high speed almost non stop, because by the time their horse got tired they would have arrived at the next point in the network and could swap to a fresh horse. This allowed people to travel at a gallop across country for very long distances, rather than a trot at best given a very fit horse. 

Also, the trade networks of the ancient world also explain why things like exotic spices were so expensive. Those products weren't just transported thousands of kilometers, they were being sold from person to person across a long chain. If you are living in a village with two other villages to your east and west, and you know that silk prices are 20% higher to the west, it makes sense for you to go east, buy silk, take it west, and sell it again, making a profit. If that village to the west has another village to *its* west where the silk prices are even higher, then it makes sense for the silk buyer to take his silk west again to make a profit. Repeat this dozens, even hundreds of times, and you end up with a trickle of silk products arriving in the far west being bought by emperors and royalty for huge prices, and at no point during this entire process does a single person need to walk more than a few dozen to a couple hundred kilometers.",61

If you just had Belle in anachronistic, corset-less outfits, without all the false feminism and shoddy design, few people would have cared. Honestly, even if her costumes were just shitty, people wouldn't have cared as much - It's the whole argument that it all happened in the name of feminism that is upsetting and offensive.",2
Tiny_Rat,The costumes are roughly inspired by French fashion in the mid- to late- 1700s,4
Tiny_Rat,"What ""shitty values"" do you think I have, exactly? What is feminist about refusing to wear a corset?

To me, Watson's very public stand on the corset issue looks a lot like an attention grab with no real beliefs or understanding behind it. She still starred in the movie, which isn't exactly a shining beacon of feminism, and she's worn corsets in other films since then. To me, those actions speak louder than her words

Edited to add:


>There is no historical era wherein a prince was turned into a beast and back by magic or any other method.

But there is a historical era from which the inspiration for most of the costumes was drawn. If you look, the only costumes that don't fit that era are Belle's. Why? Because the shape of clothing in that time period was designed with a corset in mind. Without one, you just can't have dresses of that cut, because you need to corset to shape the fabric and distribute the weight of the skirt comfortably. Since Watson wouldn't wear a corset, the dresses had to be redesigned using much lighter fabrics and fewer layers, and even then they didn't sit right. The final look was cheap and lumpy, and the fact that no other costume was designed that way only made it stand out more.",1
Tiny_Rat,"Ok, but the rest of the costumes still had a specific style associated with a particular historical time period. It makes no sense that Belle's ball gown and wedding dress have a completely different style, especially when that style isn't even consistent. It's pointless arguing that this is some artistic choice, and not an adjustment made because the actress refused to wear support garments required by the original designs. The real issue is that the whole spat between the actress and the costume designers was publicized as feminism for publicity.",1
kironex,Another comment said it better than me but effectively proves you wrong. Trade cities didn't mean that large number of foreigners sold goods there.

Now imagine the guy who buys it does the same thing. At no point did the Japanese go to Europe yet japanese goods were sold there at an incredible markup. No merchants going to spend 5 years on an insanely dangerous trek in foreign land to make a few sales. But a chain of merchants could do just that. That's how the silk roads worked.,20
Condomonium,Yeah but we’re talking one person to like a dozen max in a city of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions. Which most modern fantasy stories have. Hell Game of Thrones has PoC in the larger trade port areas like King’s Landing where that *would* be common. You’d be hardpressed to find anything other than a white person in Winterfell.

It makes sense why people farther north are white and those farther south tend towards darker skin.,19
Randvek,"I think you’ll find that humans developed black skin once they lost their body hair, and didn’t have black skin from start to finish.

WhySpongebobWhy,"To build on mmotterpops' statement, in Storm's backstory, she is basically revered as an African goddess.  Reworking her into another minority would require a reworking of that backstory because why would a Hispanic woman be revered as an African goddess?

This further complicates depending on the universe, because Storm has been married to Black Panther on more than one occasion as a symbolic union between African peoples.

The race change could be done, but it would require so much change to the character's backstory that the question becomes ""why even do it to this character in the first place?""  It'd take significantly less effort to just create a new character at this point because you won't have to consider what does or does not need to be changed to have it make (comic book) sense.",5

kironex,I wouldn't call isolated pockets diversity though. Having 10 Asians in England is far from what I'd call diverse. If say for instance a show wanted Asians in England in a 15th century setting I'd be hard press to believe thousands of Asians lived in this area. Now say a family of 20 from a successful merchant who set up shop there and maybe even has a personal guard from back home. Absolutely. I'm all for diversity in fantasy but in medivial settings logistically it wouldn't work MOST of the time without magic teleportation or some form of quick transport. Even then it would make alot of sense to have either a liberal society (Romans for example) or an absolutely massive empire (colonial European country). This is sadly because most people will self segregate given the option although considering it's fictional in this instance I don't really see why people couldn't be better than they were historically.,4

kironex,"I was thinking more New York style diversity. Now for the main cast of heros heroines that puts much more context to your previous comment of any city with trade would be diverse. The city wouldn't be diverse but the cast most definitely could. While writing my argument I was going over ways in which you could ""add"" diversity to the cast in such a setting. Like the hero was one of the guard from the wealthy asian family when he found a higher calling. Long story short you can't just insert a wide ethnic group without some consideration of how they got there in a setting that doesn't allow some form of speedy transport. Mainly due to the fact over time these groups will either die out or be assimilated by the native culture. Example: Americans often don't know thier heritage/ethnic background due to generation gaps and cultural assimilation. That's how culture works.

Edit: I'm not saying a cast can't be diverse. I agree the cast definitely could with just a minor backstory. I'm saying it would be hard to have a highly diverse city without first considering how that could happen. for the majority of human civilization areas have been dominated by one particular culture and self segregate to preserve it.",6

Since you haven't really presented an alternative position without trying to distort my words at every turn, I *do* think you're being unreasonable.",2
DrCarter11,"So per that, giving 5 things to communicate a character is black, two of them are skin color. Unless your argument is that all black people have definitively black skin, then brown skin or dark skin, such as what adolin is described with, should fit, correct?

The other three things, can make sense in a fantasy series but don't in many. For instance, to continue talking about stormlight, adolin has a high place from birth. A noble place. He is set apart from several people he interacts with because of this.  A fantasy world isn't going to have something like ""a historically black college"" unless that sort of racism exists in that world and the author wants to make a comment on it. But we have a dark skinned character who is clearly set up from some of their group and had a different upbringing than them. 

A name? What names are associated with black people in fantasy? Should writers use typical african names for those characters? How about typical african-american names? Or can I just name my fantasy character who has black skin, John? Why, because I want to.  
Trying to ascribe a history of what certain names mean, in our world, into a fantasy world seems wrong to me. 

If the character thinks about ""white people"" is the fifth one. So again, only really exists if the author has a fantasy world that has racism similar to ours and the authors wants to comment on it. If we take it to think about characters thinking about groups of ""others"" who aren't themselves, then again, characters like the previously mentioned Adolin should qualify. 


It feels like you are trying to force american/western/21st centry modern racism into fantasy when authors may not intend it to exist it there anyways. 

On the otherhand, when examples of characters that I would assume speak to something similar to a black experience, going from what you linked me and how it favorably compares to descriptions of characters in recent fantasy fiction such as Adolin are mentioned, you instead say that the experience isn't black enough? 

But why would a modern 21st experience be replicated in a world with dragons?",30

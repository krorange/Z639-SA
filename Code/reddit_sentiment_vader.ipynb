      "I think this is a consequence of who is writing the story and what it is based on Much of modern fantasy gamesstories are based on the folklore of northern Europe as well as much of the content from LOTR The majority of the people who began and participated in creating this content were of Northern European descent Quite honestly I think they did not think to add this content at first and it has come to feel like the correct ethnic group to use in the content\n",
